# GloriOS
A small project to make a small OS. Mainly just a tech demo learning experience for me
This is a HEAVY WIP, but I'll try my best to package it for Windows by May ish? And I might throw it onto MacOS and Linux if enough people care
It's built using Scratch (scratch.mit.edu and then packaged into executables using TurboWarp Packager (packager.turbowarp.org)
NOTE: if you try running the Sb3 for v.0.0.4 or later in Scratch, it will not work due to me swapping over to TurboWarp and using features that don't exist in Scratch.
